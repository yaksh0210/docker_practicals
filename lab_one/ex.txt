# 1 Delete the ubuntu Image.

ANS: Docker rmi ubuntu 

(make sure that ubuntu container is neither in 
running state nor in stopped)


# 2 You are required to pull a docker image which will be used to run a container later. Pull the image nginx:1.14-alpine

(It will only fetch an image from the repo without running container)


#3 Run a container with the nginx:1.14-alpine image and name it webapp



ANS:  docker run -d --name webapp nginx:1.14-alpine

(Run the command docker run -d --name webapp nginx:1.14-alpine 
and check the status of created container by docker ps command.)

#4 Cleanup: Delete all images on the host

ANS: docker rmi [image_name / image_id]

(it will remove all image one by one)
